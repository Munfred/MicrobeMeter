A copy of the files freely available at https://humanetechnologies.co.uk/download-microbemeter/


I am making these files available pursuant to the terms of services available at https://humanetechnologies.co.uk/terms-for-downloading-digital-content/

The terms, as they were when I downloaded these files on October 11, 2018, are copied below. 
I have also archived a copy of the terms on the internet archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20181112033523/https://humanetechnologies.co.uk/terms-for-downloading-digital-content/

Note that Humane Technologies highlights that their product is "open source" as noted on their landing page:https://web.archive.org/web/20181112033749/https://humanetechnologies.co.uk/

They note the following:
> Open-source in this context can mean either the provided equipment being an open-source hardware (i.e., fully free for development and commercialisation), or its technical blueprints being available freely for personal and academic use and development (but not for commercialisation).

Nowhere in their terms of service or advertising text they make it clear which freedoms they are concessing to the user, since they don't appear to be using any of the standard open source licenses. In particular nowhere they say explicitly that I have the right to copy and redistribute their materials, but they say the following in the terms of service

> **5.3 When you become responsible for the product. You are responsible for keeping the product secure and for backing-up your copy of the digital content.**

> 7 YOUR RIGHTS TO USE THE PRODUCT
7.1 Grant of licence. We hereby grant to you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sub licensable, revocable, royalty-free licence to use the Product on a perpetual basis solely and strictly limited to your own use as a consumer provided that you observe the following restrictions:
a. You shall not use the Product for business or commercial purposes;
b. You shall not grant sub-licences, in whole or in part, of any of the rights granted under these terms without our express written consent.
c. You may change, amend or develop the Product provided that you provide us with a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty free, world-wide, sub-licensable, transferrable licence to any such changes, amendments or developments that you make.
d. You shall comply with all applicable laws in using the Product and exercising your rights under these terms.
**e. You shall ensure that the Product is kept secure and prevent unauthorised access, copying, modification, storage, reproduction, display or distribution of the Product.**

To ensure that I am complying with their terms of service, I am therefore doing two things:

- I am backing up my copy of the product digital content in this public GitHub repository

- I am authorizing everyone in the world to browse this public GitHub repository and it's contents


I should add that I am doing this in good faith, and acting in the belief that Humane Technologies Ltd. is also acting in good faith and that when they claim that their product is open source they are abiding by the common understanding that designating some material as open source means, in particular, that the material may be freely redistributed, as I am doing here.
